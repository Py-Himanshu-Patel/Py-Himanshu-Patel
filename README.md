#### About Me

I am a passionate web developer specialized in backend mainly. During my internship I have designed backed for several production ready REST APIs from scratch till production using all industry defined standards and testing them throughly. Using **django** as framwork and **python** as language.

I also like to design fully responsive web websites from scratch till production. I have used **HTML**, **CSS** and **JS** but I consider myself still a beginner in frontend technologies.

All this with agile team environment over **JIRA** and daily scrum meet. In collobration with team over **Github** and **Slack**.
